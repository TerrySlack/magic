# Magic - Autocomplete
Just playing around with an autocomplete, displaying some images

# Setup

yarn or npm install
# Build

yarn dev or npm run dev

# Functionality
Implement the ability to mark an image as a favorite.
Add search bar allowing a user to search the collection of images, based on their input, and the images name property.
Persist favorites in local storage.  When the app is loaded or a page refresh occurs, any images marked as a favorite will
remain as favorites
